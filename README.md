# Face Recognition & Object Tracking Project

This project uses **DeepFace** for face recognition and **OpenCV** for object tracking (KCF tracker).  
It can detect faces in images/videos and verify them against a reference image.  

‚ö† **Note:**  
The `1st.py` file contains **placeholders** for image and video paths.  
Replace them with your own file paths before running the script.
